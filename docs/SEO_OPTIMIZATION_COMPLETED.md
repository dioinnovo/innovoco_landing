## Part 3: Technical SEO Enhancements

### Meta Title Optimization
**File:** `/app/layout.tsx` (line 18)

**Before:** "Innovoco | Enterprise AI & Data Transformation Services" (56 chars)
**After:** "Enterprise AI & Data Transformation | Proven Implementation Services" (68 chars)

**SEO Benefits:**

**After:** "Transform your data warehouse into an AI-powered advantage. Enterprise AI strategy, implementation, and scaling services. From POC to production in 12-16 weeks. 1000+ solutions delivered, 500+ enterprises transformed." (219 chars)

### H1 Tag Optimization (SEO + Accessibility)
**File:** `/app/(public)/page.tsx` (line 286)

**Added:**
```tsx

```

**Impact:**

## Part 4: Animation Performance Optimization

### Problem Identified
Main landing page used `animate` props (immediate animation on page load) instead of `whileInView` (scroll-triggered animations), resulting in:
- ❌ Less fluid, static feeling
- ❌ Wasted animation cycles on below-fold content
- ❌ Poor perceived performance

### Solution Implemented
Converted all sections (except hero) to scroll-triggered animations matching preview page.

### Sections Optimized

#### 1. Partnership Logos Section (Lines 399-435)
```tsx
// Before
<motion.div animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}>

// After
<motion.div
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-100px" }}
>
```

#### 2. Services Section Header (Line 740)
- Converted to `whileInView` with `-100px` margin

#### 3. All 4 Service Cards (Lines 759, 835, 910, 985)
- AI Strategy & Implementation
- Advanced Analytics & BI
- Data Engineering & Modernization
- Managed AI Operations

**Pattern Applied:**
```tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-50px" }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: 0.1 }}
>
```

#### 4. Industries Accordion Section (Line 1065)
- Section header converted to `whileInView`

### Animation Strategy
- **Hero Section:** Untouched (maintains excellent FCP/LCP scores)
- **Section Headers:** `-100px` margin (animate slightly before visible)
- **Service Cards:** `-50px` margin (tighter timing for larger elements)
- **All animations:** `once: true` (trigger once, not on every scroll)

### Performance Benefits
- ✅ Hero section FCP/LCP scores maintained
- ✅ Reduced initial JS execution
- ✅ Animations distributed across scroll
- ✅ More engaging, dynamic user experience
- ✅ Zero SEO impact (presentational only)
