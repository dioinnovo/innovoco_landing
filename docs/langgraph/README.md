# LangGraph Lead Qualification Documentation

This folder contains all documentation related to the LangGraph StateGraph implementation for the lead qualification voice AI system.

## 📚 Document Index

### 1. **LANGGRAPH_BEST_PRACTICES.md** ⭐ PRIMARY REFERENCE
**Purpose**: Complete implementation guide with verified patterns from official LangGraph.js documentation (Jan 2025)

**Contents**:
- ✅ Correct routing pattern (returns `__end__` instead of looping)
- ✅ Correct graph invocation (one invoke per turn)
- ✅ Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- ✅ Verified against official LangGraph.js docs
- ✅ Replication checklist for any AI agent

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED CORRECT - Use this for implementation

---

### 2. **LEAD_QUALIFICATION_AUDIT.md**
**Purpose**: System audit that identified problems with the keyword-based workflow

**Key Findings**:
- No actual LangGraph implementation existed
- System used fragile keyword-based state machine
- Phone UI failure root cause identified

---

### 3. **IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md**
**Purpose**: Scrum-style progress tracking with checkboxes

**Contents**:
- Epic-based task breakdown
- Completion status
